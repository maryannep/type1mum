<span class="title"><a href="./32_weeks_all_good_but_sore_fee.html"><img alt="permalink" src="./permalink.gif" width="13" height="13" /></a> 32 weeks - all good but sore feet!</span>

<p>Wow - five weeks since my last post. This is shocking but some indication of how busy life with a toddler is when you're pregnant with diabetes and trying to get heaps done!</p>

<p>From a medical point of view things are going really well. I'm 32 weeks tomorrow. Checking with my old ob's records and my endocrinologist's records I already had moderate oedema by this stage with the last pregnancy and I have none now. Yay!! This time last pregnancy I had around 2g of protein a day in my urine and this time I have 0.62g. I also have slightly higher serum albumin, which is a good thing too,  at the moment. </p>

<p>This has pretty much flabbergasted me as I had assumed that my pregnancy, oedema and pre-eclampsia wise, would follow pretty much the same timeframe as with my last pregnancy and this bub would be born at 35, 36 weeks at the latest. My daughter was born at just before 37 weeks, which I reckoned was probably too late, resulting in my caesarean scar opening due to fluid leaking out (massive oedema) and the vision and language disturbances I experienced  for days after the birth that I feel were almost certainly due to cerebral oedema (scary). I had also put on 27 kg by the time my daughter was born. This time, so far, I have put on 8kg. So fingers crossed</p>

<p>The irony is that me doing so well means bub is (hopefully!) going to arrive right at peak public holiday time over Christmas.... The docs reckon a delivery between 37 and 38 weeks is best and have penned me in for a caesarean when I am 37 weeks and 1 day along. Originally I was chuffed at this idea as it meant I'd get further along in the pregnancy than I ever expected to, but now I'm having thoughts like, 'What if I'm going really well? Will bub's lungs be mature enough? Should we pluck bub out at this pre-ordained time or let him stay in a bit longer?'.</p>

<p>The whole thing is complicated by a number of factors. Firstly I reckon my official due date of 17.1.06 is ambitious ie bub could not be due one single day earlier. I kept a 'chart' for the first time ever the month we conceived and according to my records the date of 17.1.06  means the pregnancy must have begun within a few hours of us having sex! (It was the first time we'd had sex in ten days.) I remember the night so clearly because we'd gone out for dinner that night with friends, something we very rarely do these days, and they had told us they were five weeks pregnant and said, 'here's some inspiration for you'! I had also noticed mucous (signalling ovulation) that morning, something I hadn't noticed much since having my daughter and breastfeeding (which I had only given up the month before). So the due date surely is probaby a day or two later than the 17th. Have been trying to ask doctors about this but I think they all think I'm being ridiculously pedantic. Am I making mountains out of molehills? Maybe ... but I'd love bub to stay in as long as is healthiest for the two of us and having an accurate estimate of the due date seems like part of that.</p>

<p>Problem 2. My ob gets back from overseas on the Thursday before my c-section is booked. I see her at 1pm on the Friday. Then the whole world finishes work for the Christmas holidays. I am due to have the c-section at 7am the following Wednesday (28 December) ie first working day after Christmas public holidays! So if my ob wants to change anything eg dates, people, the giving of steroids for lung maturity etc... it doesn't give her (or me) much time. Also, rescheduling would probably mean rescheduling for dead on 38 weeks, after the next public holidays for New Years and I'd be nervous about doing this unless I was able to be monitored closely over the 37-38 week period.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I am raving on, very very tired so I hope some of this is making sense.</p>

<p>Other factors are that my endo goes on leave on 1st January and my old ob who I hope might be able to assist at the caesar also goes on leave on the 1st. Hmmm...</p>

<p>My brain is fading so I should go, but remind me to write about stem cells... yet more fun and games...</p>

<p>(tee hee, when I read this more than a year later I realise I titled it ... sore feet and then went on to mention nothing about sore feet! At some point during both pregnancies, and also after bub was born, I experienced pain in the arches of my feet (no doubt because of the extra weight of either being pregnant or carrying bub and possibly the changes to the connective tissue during pregnancy). I found great relief for this by using gel arch supports (available from the chemist) inside my shoes and so far, it's only ever been very temporary.)</p>
